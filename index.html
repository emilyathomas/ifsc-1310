      <h3>Progressive Enhancement</h3>
      <p>Progressive Enhancement is a strategy for web development that puts emphasis on the content of the webpage rather than the design and
      structure, so any old browser or device can still easily view the page because the content will always be easy access.</p>
      <h3>Dragon Project Reflection</h3>
      <p>This semester went really well for me, I remember taking an html class when I was younger and enjoyed it a lot, so it was really easy going about
      the html as well as the javascript as I've worked with it before but css was definitely more of a challenge as I've never coded in it before.
      This project went really well but I wish I would've done a bit more looking and made it in a different style of my own rather than follow the
      example, but I just wanted to get it done as it was already late. A friend of mine suggested changing the normal text within the website
      but I chose to keep it, simply for it's easy readability and standard use of the font. My mom suggested I removed the borders on the tables,
      at first I declined the idea but, when I viewed my tables without it I thought it looked much nicer.</p>
