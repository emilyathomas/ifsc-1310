             <h2>The Ears and The Nose</h2>
             
             <p>The ears are one of the most <strong>important</strong> parts of the dog
             <em>alongside</em> the nose. The nose and ears are what the dog uses to help
             navigate itself. There aren't very many variations to the ears and nose, the
             ears can either stand up <strong>pointed</strong> or <strong>floop</strong> over. The nose can either be black or pink,
             sometimes in other colors too, but very rarely.</p>
             
             
             <h2>The Body</h2>
             
             <p>This part also includes the paws, especially since the size of the paw relates
             to the size of the body. There are three types of body types for dogs, but this
             part of the dog has the most variety, the body can come in all different shapes
             and sizes but there are five primary types of the body of a dog.</p>
             <ol>
                 <li>Extra Small</li>
                 <li>Small</li>
                 <li>Medium</li>
                 <li>Large</li>
                 <li>Extra Large</li>
             </ol>
             
             
             <h2>The Tail</h2>
             
             <p>unlike the body of the dog, the tail comes in only a few different varieties,
             but and each body type of dog can come with any type of tail, theres no specific
             type of tail that needs to be with a specific body type.</p>
             <ul>
                 <li>Straight</li>
                 <li>Curly</li>
                 <li>Docked</li>
             </ul>
             
             
             <h2>The Fur</h2>
             
             <p>The fur on a dog is another very <strong>important</strong> part of the dog,
             the fur helps regulate the temperature of the dog and comes in many many colors
             and lengths. Each different type of fur is for a different purpose.</p>
             <dl>
                 <dt>Short</dt>
                 <dd>typically found on dogs originating from warmer climate areas</dd>
                 <dt>Medium</dt>
                 <dd>typically can be found in dogs in cooler climates, but can be
                 found on almost any dog.</dd>
                 <dt>Long</dt>
                 <dd>typically found on dogs in cold climates, keeps them warm, typically
                 dogs with this long length of fur have a shorter coat of fur underneath
                 so that they can shed the longer coat for when the weather gets warmer.</dd>
             </dl>
             
             <h2>Dogs</h2>
             <blockquote>You can usually tell that a man is good if he has a dog who loves him.
             <cite>W. Bruce Cameron</cite></blockquote>
             <p>Dogs are a mans best friend, dogs are soft and sweet, they make mans life far better
             <q>Dogs are our link to paradise.</q> Dogs are precious, they are the most loving creatures
             and treat humans better than anything else.</p>
